# Clone Armies Clicker
Clone Armies idle game by me, because it is the best way to get rid of boredom by playing this simplistic incremental clone game

Changelog:

Version 1.5
- New clones that have joined the Clickerverse of Clone Armies is: **Engineer, Sniper and Striker!**

- More upgrades added for Commando, Cadet, Infantryman, Marksman and Rookie!
- Cost multiplier changes for some clones
- More number suffixes has been added
- Texture overhaul
- Balance changes: The first upgrade now requires 1 clone to get! Upgrade costs reduced slightly for high-tier clones, added 1 new upgrade for all clones to compensate the new balance change for upgrades
